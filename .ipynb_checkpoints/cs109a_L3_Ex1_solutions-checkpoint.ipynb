Local resident Erick Jordan carried a rifle and holstered handgun near the courthouse where Rittenhouse \\\\u003ca href=\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-kenosha-3febaa501c57a6b54e168353fe0b2a26\\\\\">was tried for killing two men and wounding a third\\\\u003c/a> with an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle during a protest last year.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“I got a job to do — protect these people. That’s it,” said Jordan, referring to speakers at a news conference that was held in the hours after the verdict.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Speakers included an uncle of Jacob Blake, the Black man who was paralyzed in a shooting by a white police officer that touched off tumultuous protests across the city in the summer of 2020.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“This is my town, my people,” Jordan said. “We don’t agree on a lot of things, but we fight, we argue, we agree to disagree and go home safe, alive.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“That’s real self-defense.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>The comments were a counter punch to political figures on the right who welcomed the Rittenhouse verdict and condemned his prosecution.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Mark McCloskey, who pleaded guilty in June to misdemeanor charges stemming from when he and his wife waved a rifle and a handgun at Black Lives Matter protesters outside their St. Louis home in 2020, said the verdict shows that people have a right to defend themselves from a “mob.” He currently is a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Missouri.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cdiv class=\\\\\"ad-placeholder\\\\\">\\\\u003c/div>\\\\u003cp>The verdict arrived as many states are expanding self-defense laws and loosening the rules for carrying guns in public.

In all, 30 states have enacted “stand your ground” laws, which remove a requirement to retreat from confrontations before using deadly force.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Wisconsin has a tougher standard for claiming self-defense, and Rittenhouse was able to show the jury that he reasonably believed his life was in danger and that the amount of force he used was appropriate.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Ryan Busse, a former firearms-industry executive who now supports moderate gun control as an author and consultant, said the case reinforced the normalization of military-style weapons on city and suburban streets.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“Reasonable gun owners are freaked out by this,” he said. “How is it that we see this and people are just like, ‘There’s a guy with an AR-15.’ That happens in third-world countries.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>He highlighted that a lesser charge against Rittenhouse as a minor in possession of a dangerous weapon \\\\u003ca href=\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/why-did-judge-drop-kyle-rittenhouse-gun-charge-d923d8e255d6b1f5c9c9fc5b74e691fb\\\\\">was dropped before the verdict.\\\\u003c/a>\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“There’s a facet of Wisconsin law that allows kids to take their hunting rifle out with their dad or uncle,” Busse said. “Well he’s not hunting. ... The old gun culture is being used to cover up for this new, dangerous firearms culture.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Gun-rights advocates seeking greater access to weapons and robust self-defense provisions argue that armed confrontations will remain rare.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Republicans including former President Donald Trump have been quick to applaud the verdict. They stand by Rittenhouse as a patriot who took a stand against lawlessness and exercised his Second Amendment rights.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Discord over the right to carry guns in public places spilled over into state legislatures in the aftermath of a 2020 plot to storm the Michigan Capitol, the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and other threats. States including Michigan and New Mexico this year banned guns at their capitols, while Montana and Utah shored up concealed-carry rights.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>At the Supreme Court, justices are weighing the biggest guns case in more than a decade, a dispute over whether New York’s gun permitting law violates the Second Amendment right to “keep and bear arms.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Defenders of the law say that striking it down would lead to more guns on the streets of cities, including New York and Los Angeles.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>During oral arguments this month, justices also \\\\u003ca href=\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-new-york-los-angeles-gun-politics-d7481cb9fd55626abec33e50f1b1a639\\\\\">appeared to worry\\\\u003c/a> that a broad ruling might threaten gun restrictions on subways and at bars, stadiums and other gathering places.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>New York’s law has been in place since 1913.

The list is led by Harris, of course, but includes other 2020 presidential candidates such as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Just last week, Booker announced plans to appear at a party fundraiser next month in New Hampshire, which traditionally hosts the nation\\'s first presidential primary election.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cdiv id=\\\\\"afs:Card:998546486860\\\\\" class=\\\\\"hub-peek-embed\\\\\">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout \\\\u003c/div>\\\\u003cp>Booker\\'s team sought to tamp down chatter that he was positioning himself to run in 2024, and allies say he is very close to Harris and would not challenge her in the event Biden retires. Still, the mere existence of such conversations so soon into a new presidency is unusual.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>The frustrations boiling over now may be long forgotten by the time Biden — or another Democrat — leads the party in the 2024 presidential election. The truth is, no one knows what the standing of Biden or Harris will be next year, never mind in three years. While Biden\\'s approval ratings are hovering in the low 40s, they are better than Donald Trump\\'s at the same time of his presidency.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Barack Obama also faced headwinds at the end of the first year of his presidency. His party would go on to suffer historic losses in the 2010 midterm elections. But Obama recovered in time to win a second term. Bill Clinton similarly overcame setbacks, including a devastating midterm cycle in 1994, to win reelection in 1996.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Democratic strategist Bill Burton, who worked in the Obama White House, noted that any number of factors could completely upend the political climate, such as Trump\\'s reemergence, a Supreme Court decision ending or dramatically limiting abortion rights, an improving economy and the end of the pandemic.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“There’s such a unanimity around the idea that Democrats are completely doomed. These are the same people who brought us President Hillary Clinton,” Burton said. “Maybe things aren’t as bad as the entire chattering class seems to think they are.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>The White House is working to quash speculation that Biden may not seek reelection in 2024 given his current struggles. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Noting that Biden has declared his intent to run publicly and privately, his aides say the Democratic National Committee and Biden\\'s political team inside the White House are actively moving forward with the assumption he will seek a second term.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>They believe Biden\\'s position will improve as voters digest the new infrastructure law and the $2 trillion social spending and climate bill currently moving through Congress. Already, the DNC and its allies are focusing significant resources on selling the Democrats\\' accomplishments in key states before the 2022 midterm elections — states such as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin that will also be top battlegrounds in the 2024 presidential election.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Despite their optimism, tensions inside the White House are real as the new leadership team learns to work together.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Harris\\' allies are especially frustrated that Biden seems to have limited the vice president to a low-profile role with a difficult policy portfolio — led by voting rights and immigration.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>She was traveling with reporters in Ohio on Friday when Kyle Rittenhouse was \\\\u003ca href=\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/jury-finds-kyle-rittenhouse-not-guilty-in-kenosha-shootings-27f812ba532d65c044617483c915e4de\\\\\">acquitted of all charges\\\\u003c/a> in last year\\'s deadly shootings in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that became a flashpoint in the debate over guns, vigilantism and racial injustice. But she had to wait until Biden had addressed the case before she could weigh in, saying “the verdict really speaks for itself.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>And when she delivered her speech on the infrastructure law, there was little sign of Democratic enthusiasm.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>The crowd of invited guests barely filled one-quarter of a local union hall. Almost none of Ohio\\'s top Democrats attended the event, including Sen. Sherrod Brown or the high-profile Democrats running for governor. Rep. Joyce Beatty, who represents the district where Harris spoke, was the only member of Congress in attendance.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“Because of our work together, America is moving forward,” Harris declared, explaining that the infrastructure law would \\\\\"make the most significant investment to fix our road and bridges in 70 years.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>But just as in New Hampshire, the White House\\'s message was clouded by frustration over Biden\\'s presidency. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Ohio Democrat Nina Turner, who served as co-chair of Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign, said “very little has changed” for the poor and middle-class since Biden replaced Trump. The infrastructure bill does not change that, she said, and she blasted Biden\\'s social spending package as “build back less better.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“The question becomes, ‘Why am I helping you to hold to power, when the power you have right now you’re not using on my behalf?’” Turner said of Biden. “That’s called insanity — asking me to vote for you, asking the Black community to come out for you in 2022 or 2024 when you ain\\'t doing nothing in 2021.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Indeed, Rev.

The department has had to pay higher prices to the farm in Pennsylvania that supplies the trees.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cdiv class=\\\\\"ad-placeholder\\\\\">\\\\u003c/div>\\\\u003cp>Darts Christmas Tree Farm in Southold sold out of mature trees last year for the first time in 50 years, and also sold many that weren\\'t mature yet, leaving the farm with fewer large trees this year, owner Ed Dart said. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Several factors are at work. Farmers struggling after the economic recession in 2009 planted fewer trees for several years, and demand has been rising in the last several years, experts told Newsday. It takes eight to 10 years for a tree to reach maturity. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cdiv id=\\\\\"afs:Card:166276210093\\\\\" class=\\\\\"hub-peek-embed\\\\\">Hub peek embed (apf-topnews) - Compressed layout \\\\u003c/div>\\\\u003cp>Shipments of artificial trees have been delayed this year due to supply chain issues including a shortage of truck drivers to make deliveries. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“Some of the major retailers say they have about 43 percent of their inventory right now when it should be closer to 70 percent at this time of the year,” Jami Warner, executive director of the American Christmas Tree Association, which represents Christmas tree retailers, told the newspaper.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Costello’s Ace Hardware, which sells artificial trees at 22 locations on Long Island, has raised prices as much as 25 percent, category manager Andy Pergament told the newspaper.

Amnesty International has highlighted the need for deeper investigations into the cause of deaths, the lack of a right to form unions and the need for all companies to comply with newer laws saying workers should be allowed to leave jobs without permission of the employer. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“There’s criticism,” Al Khater said. “There’s work that needs to be done. There is, however, a lot of progress but unfortunately that has not been captured in reports such as Amnesty, Human Rights Watch.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Twelve countries, as well as Qatar as host, have so far secured qualification for the 32-team event. Denmark has said its training kit in Qatar will feature critical human rights messages, ensuring the tournament will feature player activism.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>The building work is starting to wind down. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“All eight stadiums for the World Cup are complete,” Al Khater said. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Seven venues are now ready to stage matches, with Stadium 974 built using that number of shipping containers to be inaugurated later this month at the FIFA Arab Cup that is serving as a test event for the World Cup.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cdiv class=\\\\\"ad-placeholder\\\\\">\\\\u003c/div>\\\\u003cp>A 40-minute drive north takes fans to the 80,000-capacity Losail Stadium that will stage the final on Dec. 18, 2022 but is not ready for games. Nearby is also the Losail International Circuit where Formula One defending world champion Lewis Hamilton said ahead of Sunday’s inaugural Qatar Grand Prix that the country still has a “long way to go” on ensuring equality.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Hamilton is wearing a rainbow-colored helmet in Qatar to draw attention to the anti-LGBTQ+ laws that World Cup organizers effectively suggest won’t be enforced during the tournament. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“Everybody is welcome to come to Qatar and have an enjoyable time at the World Cup,” Al Khater said. “They can come and enjoy their time here without fear of any sort of repercussions, it makes no difference to people’s (sexual) orientation, religion, creed, race whatsoever.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Al Khater said any couple could share a hotel room.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“I don’t know if this is a misconception,” he said. “I don’t know where you know, where you get this from. I mean, anybody is free to stay in a hotel, whether with their friend, with their partner.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>The challenge for supporters could still be affording the trip. Even though it’s a World Cup requiring no flights between games, demand for accommodation could be stretched in the tiny Gulf nation. What helps fans is being able to stay in neighboring countries, including the United Arab Emirates, after they lifted an economic, diplomatic and travel boycott of Qatar this year that had been running since 2017.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“The ultimate goal is to have a successful World Cup and you can only have a successful World Cup when you have fans attending,” Al Khater said. “So this has been taken into consideration to make sure that there’s plentiful accommodation and there’s accommodation available for all budgets.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Fans will be traveling months later than usual for the World Cup. Opening on Nov. 21, 2022, with the final on Dec. 18, remains contentious as the major European leagues finalize the starting dates for a season so significantly disrupted for the first time by the World Cup.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Qatar bid for the World Cup under FIFA’s terms for the usual June-July slot, with the schedule change only decided after the vote. The now largely discredited committee of FIFA executives that voted by a majority for Qatar overlooked concerns about the heat. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>That vote has remained under the cloud of corruption.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>A FIFA-commissioned probe highlighted the unease of investigators looking into Qatar’s methods to win the vote but concluded there was no “evidence of any improper activity by the bid team.” American attorney Michael Garcia did, however, find that some of Qatar’s conduct “may not have met the standards” required by FIFA.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Fresh allegations of wrongdoing surfaced last year when American prosecutors revealed new details of alleged bribes paid by Qatar for votes. An indictment said Nicolás Leoz, then president of the South American governing body CONMEBOL, and former Brazil federation president Ricardo Teixeira received bribes to vote for Qatar.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“All of these investigations have shown us that Qatar has been vindicated of all the allegations made against it,” Al Khater said when asked about the claims that emerged in the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. “So whatever you’re referring to, I deny categorically.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>___\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\\\\u003c/p>\",\"alertLinkDateTime\":null,\"storyLayout\":{},\"reporters\":[],\"headlinePlacement\":null,\"relatedStoryEmbeds\":[],\"disableNativo\":false}],\"disclaimerText\":null,\"dividerColor\":null,\"expandedStoryCount\":null,\"feed\":[],\"headlineWidget\":false,\"hubPeekLinkText\":null,\"hubPeekTagId\":null,\"hubPeekTagName\":null,\"hubPeekCanonicalName\":null,\"hubPeekIsPr\":null,\"minimizedStoryCount\":null,\"tagObjs\":[{\"id\":\"Soccer\",\"name\":\"Soccer\",\"canonicalName\":\"soccer\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"apf-sports\",\"name\":\"Sports\",\"canonicalName\":\"sports\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"apf-business\",\"name\":\"Business\",\"canonicalName\":\"business\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"apf-mideast\",\"name\":\"Middle East\",\"canonicalName\":\"middle-east\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"apf-AutoRacing\",\"name\":\"Auto Racing\",\"canonicalName\":\"auto-racing\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"apf-topnews\",\"name\":\"AP Top News\",\"canonicalName\":\"ap-top-news\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"apf-EuropeanSports\",\"name\":\"Sports -

This shows that this brand is really powerful even some 37 years after the original became a cultural phenomenon.” \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>The weekend’s other high-profile offering didn’t fare as well. “King Richard,” the well-reviewed drama starring Will Smith as the father of tennis greats Venus and Serena Williams, earned $5.7 million from 3,302 locations, missing its modest expectations by almost half. The Warner Bros. film was released simultaneously on HBO Max and in theaters. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“It really is have and have nots,” said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros. head of domestic distribution. “Clearly the avid moviegoers are starting to come back, but more casual moviegoers are more reluctant.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Although traditional blockbusters have managed to draw decent audiences, dramas have disproportionately struggled during the pandemic. Most have debuted in the $3 million range. One of the more successful launches was the Aretha Franklin biopic “Respect,” which opened to $8.8 million.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>But the outlook could be promising for “King Richard” with its 92% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, A CinemaScore from audiences and long awards season runway. In 2018, “Green Book” opened on Thanksgiving weekend to only $5.5 million, but by the end of awards season it had grossed $85 million.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Meanwhile, in limited release from A24, Mike Mills’ “C’mon C’mon” had the best limited platform debut since February 2020 with $134,447 from five screens. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix as man looking after his 9-year-old nephew. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>The box office is still far from where it was pre-pandemic. The weekend leading into Thanksgiving usually usually gets around $200 million in ticket sales, but this weekend will net out around $83 million. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>At this point, the 2021 North American box office could net out with around $4 billion.

Saied has also taken aim at the country’s judiciary, whose ranks he claims are filled with corrupt judges who must “be cleansed.” Observers have called Tunisia’s political crisis a step back in the country’s democratic transition. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>During his recent sentence, Ayari says he was filmed with video cameras in his cell and denied access to correspondence.

Angry residents are deluging officials with complaints and filing lawsuits, while some leading companies are installing new equipment, making payments to neighbors or even closing down.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>No one tracks such disputes, but Iowa State University professor Jacek Koziel, who studies air quality and livestock odors, said he thinks the conflicts may be increasing. Sometimes, as in Des Moines, it’s because more noses are nearer the bad smells, but in other spots, it\\'s that residents are simply pushing harder for changes.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“It’s very common in this juncture of animal agriculture in general and meat packing plants or feed processing plants,” Koziel said. “It’s very tough.

As more people moved nearby, the company said, it had invested millions of dollars on new technology, such as air treatment equipment, to reduce odors.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“We also follow a rigorous daily cleaning schedule during and after each production run,” the statement said. “At the end of each week, we perform a top-to-bottom deep cleaning to keep odor to a minimum.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Even with efforts to reduce smells, rendering is an especially pungent business. The plants use heat, centrifuges and other techniques to convert waste animal tissue into fats and proteins for many uses, including as animal feed, fertilizer and cosmetics. There are more than 200 plants in the U.S. and Canada, according to recent estimates.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>In Fresno, California, a citizens group filed a lawsuit against a Darling rendering plant that produced a stench so strong that residents complained of health problems. Last year, the company agreed to close the plant.

Kishida’s predecessor, Yoshihide Suga, resigned after only a year in office, mainly because of widespread dissatisfaction with the government’s pandemic response.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Speaking up takes courage in a conformist society like Japan, and class action lawsuits are rare. But Kaori Takada, Takeuchi\\'s sister, and others in her group believe their loved ones were denied the medical care they deserved.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“I had to raise my voice,” she said.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>She is not sure what she will do.

In some cases, ambulances were shunted from one hospital to the next.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cdiv class=\\\\\"ad-placeholder\\\\\">\\\\u003c/div>\\\\u003cp>A few makeshift facilities provided treatment and supplemental oxygen, but calls to set up big field hospitals went unheeded. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>In New York, for instance, hospitals were quickly converted, adding thousands of extra beds and ICUs for virus patients. A Navy medical ship and other facilities were turned into makeshift hospitals. At the outbreak\\'s peak in April 2020, there were more than 1,600 new hospitalizations a day citywide.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>In August of this year, when infections in Japan surged with the spread of the delta variant, Japan\\'s hospital systems were quickly declared “stretched thin,” even though it has had far fewer COVID-19 cases than the U.S., Europe and some other Asian and South American countries. In early September, more than 134,000 people were sick with the virus at home, according to Health Ministry records. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>About 18,000 Japanese have died of COVID-19-related deaths in a population of 126 million. No one knows exactly how many died at home, though the National Police Agency, which tracks deaths, said 951 people have died at home since March 2020, with 250 of them in August 2021 alone. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Shigeru Omi, a top government adviser on the coronavirus and head of the Japan Community Health Care Organization, or JCHO, has urged the government to set up emergency field hospitals, specifically to avoid deaths from “jitaku ryoyo.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Japan\\'s health care system is dominated by small, private hospitals and clinics, and few inpatient facilities are equipped to handle infectious diseases. Many beds are occupied by psychiatric patients and by the chronically ill and elderly, and there are relatively few doctors, intensive care specialists and nurses.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>In some places, local authorities arranged for such hospitals to accept patients who were no longer infectious and rehabilitating from serious illness after they were treated at larger hospitals. But overall, caseloads vastly outnumbered the beds available for critical care. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>The JCHO runs 57 of Japan\\'s biggest hospitals. All are heavily subsidized by taxpayer money. The Health Ministry said it provided up to 100,000 yen ($900) per bed for COVID-19 patients.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>In October, JCHO said it had prepared 972 beds nationwide for virus patients, or fewer than 7% of its more than 14,000 overall beds, though in August it temporarily made room for about 1,800 patients.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>JCHO declined to comment on Kishida\\'s call for providing thousands more beds. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Dr. Takanori Yamamoto, a critical care physician at Nagoya University, believes hospital care needs to be restructured to focus on seriously ill patients in designated facilities, instead of spreading them across small hospitals that each have a handful of ICU beds.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Resources were improperly managed, including widespread hospitalizations of people who didn\\'t need it, he said. Public health bureaus are designed for research and are ill-suited to be “gatekeepers” for doling out COVID-19 care, he added. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>The problems are deeply rooted in a decades-old system, and Yamamoto worries that even if Japan manages to ride out this pandemic, it will be unprepared for the next one. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“No other nation turned away patients like this, even countries that had far more cases. The idea of doctors not seeing patients should be out of the question. If you are a doctor, you have to take care of the sick,\\\\\" Yamamoto said. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“Japan has done nothing. There has been no leadership,\\\\\" he said. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>The time to act is now, before another wave of coronavirus infections hits, said Dr. Kenji Shibuya, research director at the Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research, an independent think tank.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“They didn’t act before, even though they knew it’s coming,” said Shibuya, who has experience working in Britain. “It is about a lack of commitment, lack of will, lack of passion to make a change at a time of crisis,” he said.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Back in August, Yuko Nishizato, co-founder of Takada\\'s group, pleaded with hospitals for her 73-year-old father to be admitted. But he died after testing positive for COVID-19 without ever getting treatment, apart from medication for a fever. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Phone records show he repeatedly called the local public health center right up to his death. It breaks her heart to know all he got were recordings. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“I wanted him to live to see his grandchildren. I wanted him to see a more grown-up me,” Nishizato said. “There are so many who have suffered the same way, and I don’t understand why.” \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>—-\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Follow AP’s coronavirus coverage at: \\\\u003ca href=\\\\\"https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic\\\\\">https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic\\\\u003c/a>\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>___\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Yuri Kageyama is on Twitter https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\\\\u003c/p>\",\"alertLinkDateTime\":null,\"storyLayout\":{},\"reporters\":[],\"headlinePlacement\":null,\"relatedStoryEmbeds\":[],\"disableNativo\":false}],\"disclaimerText\":null,\"dividerColor\":null,\"expandedStoryCount\":null,\"feed\":[],\"headlineWidget\":false,\"hubPeekLinkText\":null,\"hubPeekTagId\":null,\"hubPeekTagName\":null,\"hubPeekCanonicalName\":null,\"hubPeekIsPr\":null,\"minimizedStoryCount\":null,\"tagObjs\":[{\"id\":\"Coronaviruspandemic\",\"name\":\"Coronavirus pandemic\",\"canonicalName\":\"coronavirus-pandemic\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"apf-business\",\"name\":\"Business\",\"canonicalName\":\"business\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"apf-Health\",\"name\":\"Health\",\"canonicalName\":\"health\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"apf-asiapac\",\"name\":\"Asia Pacific\",\"canonicalName\":\"asia-pacific\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"apf-topnews\",\"name\":\"AP Top News\",\"canonicalName\":\"ap-top-news\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"apf-WorldNews\",\"name\":\"World News\",\"canonicalName\":\"world-news\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"Japan\",\"name\":\"Japan\",\"canonicalName\":\"japan\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"Tokyo\",\"name\":\"Tokyo\",\"canonicalName\":\"tokyo\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"Publichealth\",\"name\":\"Public health\",\"canonicalName\":\"public-health\",\"isPr\":false}],\"textColor\":null,\"layoutType\":null,\"customLayoutType\":null,\"endDateTime\":null,\"teamLimit\":25,\"medalCounts\":null,\"medalsUpdated\":null,\"notificationUrl\":null,\"notificationText\":null,\"notificationTitle\":null,\"notificationType\":null,\"notificationUpdated\":null},{\"id\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:ae3562fb5685199c3f572c122e24bcef\",\"shortId\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:ae3562fb5685199c3f572c122e24bcef\",\"allowAd\":true,\"borderColor\":null,\"brackets\":null,\"bracketsSettings\":null,\"cardTitle\":null,\"cardHeadline\":null,\"cardType\":\"Wire Story\",\"collectionTagObjs\":null,\"contents\":[{\"id\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:ae3562fb5685199c3f572c122e24bcef\",\"shortId\":\"ae3562fb5685199c3f572c122e24bcef\",\"bylines\":\"By BILL CORMIER\",\"canonicalUrl\":\"business-media-atlanta\",\"contentType\":\"text\",\"disableConnatix\":false,\"downloadSettings\":{},\"embedCaption\":null,\"embedHeight\":null,\"embedHTML\":null,\"embedLinkURL\":null,\"firstWords\":\"\\\\u003cp>ATLANTA (AP) — A passenger awaiting a search at the Atlanta airport\\'s main security checkpoint reached in his bag and grabbed a firearm, and it went off, causing chaos among travelers and prompting a temporary FAA ground stop on flights Saturday afternoon, officials said.\\\\u003c/p>\",\"hasTextOverlay\":false,\"headline\":\"Atlanta airport checkpoint chaos: Man grabs gun, it goes off\",\"description\":null,\"interactiveLinkUrl\":null,\"interactiveLinkUrlText\":null,\"language\":\"en\",\"leadPhotoId\":\"c5ff73621165483e8b84786e6037eeac\",\"leadVideoId\":null,\"localLinkUrl\":\"https://apnews.com/ae3562fb5685199c3f572c122e24bcef\",\"localMemberName\":null,\"media\":[{\"id\":\"c5ff73621165483e8b84786e6037eeac\",\"type\":\"Photo\",\"caption\":\"\\\\u003cp>In this undated booking photo provided by the Atlanta Police Department is suspect Kenny Wells.

He pointed to Africa\\'s impoverished Sahel region, which is seeing increasing terrorist activity, as an example. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>What is causing this change in how U.N. peacekeepers have to operate are a number of factors starting with increased political divisions among the U.N.’s 193 member nations, he said.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cdiv class=\\\\\"ad-placeholder\\\\\">\\\\u003c/div>\\\\u003cp>The drivers of conflict are increasing, Lacroix said, and there are also what he called “conflict enhancers,” including digital technologies, the impact of fake news and misinformation on conflicts, and “armed groups using increasingly sophisticated means to undermine our actions.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>The U.N. currently has 12 far-flung peacekeeping operations — six in Africa, four in the Middle East, one in Europe and one in Asia — with the more than 66,000 military personnel from 121 countries joined by over 7,000 international police and 14,000 civilians.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Lacroix said peacekeepers continue to make “a huge difference” in countries where they oversee cease-fires like Cyprus and south Lebanon in terms of preventing conflict, and “they also make a huge difference in terms of protection of civilians, even though we would like to be able to do more.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>But the undersecretary-general for peace operations said the drivers of conflict “are massively impacting the conflicts in which we’re involved.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“They pose increasingly important threats to countries in which our missions are deployed, and frankly to the region where we are operating,” he said.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“Are we equipped enough as a multilateral system to address these threats?\\\\\" Lacroix asked rhetorically. “I’m not sure. I think there’s probably more that should be done in those areas.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>He called an upcoming ministerial meeting on U.N. peacekeeping in Seoul, South Korea on Dec. 7-8 an important opportunity to improve the performance and impact of peacekeepers and “the effectiveness of our tools,” and to mobilize international support for these efforts. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cdiv class=\\\\\"ad-placeholder\\\\\">\\\\u003c/div>\\\\u003cp>Lacroix said “a significant number” of ministers and senior officials from all U.N. member states are expected in Seoul, stressing that high-level participation is “critically important” as an expression of support for U.N. peacekeeping, which is funded by a separate U.N. budget amounting to $6.38 billion for the year ending June 30, 2022, as well as voluntary contributions.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>He said the peacekeeping department has circulated a list to U.N. member nations of what it needs to improve the protection of peacekeepers against ambushes, improvised explosive devices and attacks, and to protect their camps. The list also includes improved medical support and equipment to make peacekeepers more nimble, mobile and reactive, especially more helicopters, he said.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Lacroix said there are two other very important areas: improving the missions’ ability to collect and process information to better prevent threats instead of having to react to them, and increasing the number of women in peacekeeping operations “because we know for a fact that more women in peacekeeping means more effective peacekeeping.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>He said it will be “tremendously important” to have governments support the department’s “strategy for the digital transformation of peacekeeping because we strongly believe that if we make the best possible use of these new technologies, then it can be a game changer for peacekeeping.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>To do that, he said, the U.N. has to improve what he called “the digital literacy of peacekeeping and our peacekeepers,” which means more training.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>If the peacekeeping department and peacekeepers are better at using digital technology, the men and women in the field can be better protected, Lacroix said. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“We can probably better communicate and also counter misinformation,” and the U.N. can better collect and process information “in a way that can enable effective action,\\\\\" he said.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>But Lacroix said if peacekeeping is to succeed — “which is to create the conditions where peacekeeping missions can leave” — it is “critically important” that governments support political efforts to achieve this goal.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>He said there must also be a recognition that more and more peacekeeping operations are part of broader efforts and partnerships that can build different capacities, including security, or help provide humanitarian assistance in places like Congo, South Sudan or Mali. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“We have to make sure that we are playing a role where you can make the best possible difference, and other partners have to have that same approach, and we need to be complementary to each other,” Lacroix

Pierce tweeted a video of Rittenhouse speaking by phone from a jail in Illinois, where he\\'s from, thanking supporters. A video released by a group tied to his legal team said Rittenhouse was being “sacrificed by politicians” whose “end game” was to stop the “constitutional right of all citizens to defend our communities.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Rivers of money flowed to a legal defense fund — more than enough for Rittenhouse to post his $2 million bail — but Wood left the case and became active in pressing the false claim that Donald Trump had won the presidential election. Pierce left the criminal case in December after prosecutors said he shouldn’t be allowed to raise money for Rittenhouse, but he stayed on the civil side of things until Rittenhouse said he fired him in February.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>On Friday, Richards recounted his first meeting with Rittenhouse: “I told him when I first met him, if he’s looking for somebody to go off on a crusade, I wasn’t his lawyer.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Wood told the AP on Saturday that he\\'s not a criminal lawyer and hasn\\'t been involved in the civil side of things since he was asked to withdraw. He said the foundation he heads, Fightback Foundation, raised money for Rittenhouse\\'s bail and publicly said the case was a Second Amendment issue.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“I was not an attorney pushing for a cause,” Wood said. “Fightback has a mission that includes the right to bear arms and self-defense.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Richards — gravel-voiced, gruff and often sprawled back in his chair during the proceedings — had seemed to be the lead attorney in the months leading up to the trial. After the verdicts, he called Chirafisi his co-counsel — “not second chair” — and referred to him as his “best friend.\\\\\" \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>They came to court prepared. Richards used several videos during his opening statement — over the objection of prosecutors who did not seize on that opportunity. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>They argued vehemently for a mistrial when they felt prosecutors were acting in bad faith, and \\\\u003ca href=\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/why-did-judge-drop-kyle-rittenhouse-gun-charge-d923d8e255d6b1f5c9c9fc5b74e691fb\\\\\">appeared to outmaneuver prosecutors\\\\u003c/a> in getting a gun charge dismissed.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>And they made a careful calculation with perhaps their biggest decision: whether \\\\u003ca href=\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/kyle-rittenhouse-george-floyd-racial-injustice-kenosha-shootings-f92074af4f2668313e258aa2faf74b1c\\\\\">Rittenhouse should take the stand\\\\u003c/a>, risking a potentially damaging cross-examination. Richards said they tested their case against a pair of mock juries and found it was “substantially better” with Rittenhouse testifying.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“It wasn’t a close call,” he said.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Richards is a courtroom veteran and was a prosecutor in Racine and Kenosha counties in the late 1980s before he opened his own firm in 1990 that specializes in criminal defense. Chirafisi is also a former prosecutor and has been practicing law for more than 20 years. His law firm is in Madison. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>The attorneys repeatedly pushed back against prosecutors’ notion that Rittenhouse was an outsider drawn to Kenosha by the chaos, noting that although he lived in nearby Antioch, Illinois, his father lived in Kenosha and Rittenhouse worked in Kenosha County as a lifeguard. Richards shared his own distress at watching the violence in Kenosha from his home in Racine after the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a white police officer.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>While prosecutors tried to show that Rittenhouse acted as a vigilante who overreacted, he and his lawyers argued that he was defending himself. “You as jurors will end up looking at it from the standpoint of a 17-year-old under the circumstances as they existed,” Richards told the jury.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>When Rittenhouse was on the stand, they were quick to object to the prosecutor\\'s cross-examination, calling it badgering. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>In one fiery moment of the trial, after the defense objected to prosecutor Thomas Binger\\'s line of questioning, Chirafisi raised the prospect that Binger was trying to provoke a mistrial because the state was faring poorly.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“I don’t know that it’s my role to sit here and say who’s winning,” Chirafisi told the judge. “I don’t think that’s necessarily what I’m supposed to do. But I think the court has to make some findings as it relates to the bad faith on the part of the prosecution.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Richards and Chirafisi split the duties at trial, with Richards doing the opening statement and closing argument and Chirafisi handling much of the witness testimony. Richards said the two argued over who would question Gaige Grosskreutz, the man who had a gun in his hand when Rittenhouse shot and wounded him. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Richards said Chirafisi won — and did a better job than he would have. Chirafisi got Grosskreutz to admit that he had pointed his gun at Rittenhouse.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“It wasn’t until you pointed your gun at him, advanced on him … that he fired, right?” Chirafisi asked.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“Correct,” Grosskreutz replied. Under follow-up questioning from the prosecutor, Grosskreutz said he never meant to point his weapon at Rittenhouse.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Strang, who helped represent Steven Avery in the case documented by the Netflix “Making a Murderer” series, described Chirafisi as quick-witted and always engaged in the courtroom. Strang said Richards is slow to anger, but “won\\'t let go” if he thinks something is unfair.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>That was evident during Richards’ closing argument when, in his booming voice, he looked at the prosecutors\\' table and repeatedly accused Binger of lying. Jurors appeared riveted. Richards repeated his distaste for the way prosecutors presented their case on Friday. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>He also blamed social media for spreading what he called “not the true story” of the events in Kenosha right after they happened — “something we had to work to overcome in court.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“I knew this case was big,” Richards told reporters. “I never knew it was going to be this big.” \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>___\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>This story has been corrected to delete a reference to Carlson documentary to air Monday; it is to air in December.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>___ \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Forliti reported from Minneapolis.

West Africa’s Sahel region is the vast area south of the Sahara Desert where extremist groups are fighting for control.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“It would be especially unfortunate if outside actors engage in making things even more difficult and more complicated,” he said.

He also promoted sustainable development, women’s empowerment and other human rights initiatives to bolster faltering democracies.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>In meetings with female entrepreneurs and executives from U.S.-based multinational companies, Blinken extolled the benefits of boosting women\\'s roles in economies and of buying American. In a jab at China, with which the U.S. competes for lucrative business, he noted that America invests “without saddling the country with a debt that it cannot handle.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“The effects are going to be felt inside of Senegal, improving infrastructure, creating jobs and reinforcing public safety and climate resilience,” he said as he witnessed the signing of four road, traffic management and other deals between Senegal and U.S. firms worth about $1 billion.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>The investment, he said, shows “our shared values of democracy, transparency and rule of law as well as innovation.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>In less than two weeks Senegal will host a major China-Africa trade and investment forum, underscoring Beijing\\'s interest in increasing the scope of its influence on the continent. U.S.-China competition in Africa has been a major underlying theme of Blinken\\'s trip, although he has tried to downplay it.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“Our purpose is not to make our partners choose, it is to give them choices,” he said. \\\\\"And when people have choices, they usually make the right one.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Tall Sall, the foreign minister who will play a major role in the forum, thanked Blinken for his comments.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“We have a diplomacy of sovereignty from which we do not exclude anyone,\\\\\" she said. “There is not only one choice.

It opened in 2019 as an abortion option for people from Missouri and other nearby Republican-governed states. It\\'s seeing an increase in patients from farther away as a tough ban in Texas creates appointment backlogs throughout the south-central U.S.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Dr. Colleen McNicholas, Planned Parenthood’s chief medical officer for reproductive health services in the St. Louis region, said the clinic is bracing for a possible influx of an additional 14,000 women per year seeking abortion services if post-Roe bans proliferate.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“We’re absolutely thinking about what operational changes we would need — staying open seven days a week, operating two shifts each day – to absorb that many patients,” she said.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Already, patients are “super frustrated” by drives of up to nine hours from home, she said.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Michael New, an abortion opponent who teaches social research at The Catholic University of America, said possible increases of out-of-state abortions and “mail-order abortions” would be among several challenges facing the anti-abortion movement even as its dream of Roe’s demise came true.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Another potential challenge: Some Democratic-leaning prosecutors might refuse to enforce bans. \\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Michigan, for example, has a 90-year-old ban on the books. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, says she wouldn\\'t enforce it if it became law; a local prosecutor, Democrat Eli Savit in Washtenaw County, tweeted, “We will never, ever prosecute any person for exercising reproductive freedom.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>While there’s a consensus that Roe is more vulnerable than ever, there\\'s no certainty about how the Supreme Court might proceed. Clues will surface on Dec. 1, when justices hear arguments in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>In that case, Mississippi is \\\\u003ca href=\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/health-abortion-us-supreme-court-mississippi-57342eb0af27efe5c7cda5062105bd7f\\\\\">asking the court to overrule Roe\\\\u003c/a> and a follow-up 1992 decision that prevents states from banning abortion before viability, the point around 24 weeks of pregnancy when a fetus can survive outside the womb.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>If the court simply upholds Mississippi\\'s ban, other Republican-governed states would likely enact similar measures. The Guttmacher Institute says between 6.3% and 7.4% of U.S. abortions, or 54,000 to 63,000 annually, are obtained at or after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>However, activists on opposing sides believe the high court — either in the Mississippi case or a subsequent one — is poised to go further, nullifying Roe so states would be free to impose sweeping bans.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“For nearly 50 years, states have been prevented from passing abortion laws that reflect the values of people who live there,” said Mallory Quigley of the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. “Dobbs is the best opportunity since 1973 to correct that.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Wisconsin could become one of the most contested battlegrounds, since it still has in its statutes an 1849 law criminalizing abortion. But even if the law took effect, it might not be enforced if next year’s election leaves Democrats serving as governor, attorney general and as district attorneys in Milwaukee and Madison, which are home to abortion clinics.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>The 2022 elections are likely to energize activists in each camp, says Julaine Appling, an abortion opponent who leads the Wisconsin Family Council.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“The smart candidates running on either side will say it makes a huge difference who is governor and who is attorney general,” she said. “Wisconsin is very purple — and we’ve got a real fight on our hands on this issue.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>When Roe was decided, abortion was broadly legal in four states, allowed under limited circumstances in 16 others, and outlawed under nearly all circumstances elsewhere. In 1974, a year after Roe, there were about 900,000 abortions in the U.S., according to the Guttmacher Institute.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Abortions rose steadily, peaking at 1.61 million in 1990, before a steady decline — falling to 862,000 in Guttmacher’s latest survey, covering 2017. The decline is attributed to increased availability of effective contraception and a plunge in unintended pregnancies, notably among teens.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Women also have safer, easier options for terminating pregnancies; \\\\u003ca href=\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-abortion-texas-covid-19-pandemic-health-13c2fbe3f1de416d88a5ef6d1ca3406e\\\\\">medication abortions\\\\u003c/a> now account for about 40% of U.S. abortions. Advocacy groups are spreading the word about abortion pills that can be used at home without a medical professional’s involvement.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Increased use of mail-order pills could pose a dilemma for the anti-abortion movement, given that its leaders generally say they don’t favor criminalizing the actions of women seeking abortions. Pills often are shipped from overseas; those suppliers are an elusive target for prosecutors.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Arons, the ACLU lawyer, says anti-abortion activists are deluding themselves if they think post-Roe bans can enable them to live in abortion-free states.\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>“People who want to end their pregnancies will find a way to do so, whether it’s legal or not,” she said. “The need will always be there.”\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>___\\\\u003c/p>\\\\u003cp>Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through The Conversation U.S. The AP is solely responsible for this content.\\\\u003c/p>\",\"alertLinkDateTime\":null,\"storyLayout\":{},\"reporters\":[],\"headlinePlacement\":null,\"relatedStoryEmbeds\":[],\"disableNativo\":false}],\"disclaimerText\":null,\"dividerColor\":null,\"expandedStoryCount\":null,\"feed\":[],\"headlineWidget\":false,\"hubPeekLinkText\":null,\"hubPeekTagId\":null,\"hubPeekTagName\":null,\"hubPeekCanonicalName\":null,\"hubPeekIsPr\":null,\"minimizedStoryCount\":null,\"tagObjs\":[{\"id\":\"Abortion\",\"name\":\"Abortion\",\"canonicalName\":\"abortion\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"apf-Health\",\"name\":\"Health\",\"canonicalName\":\"health\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"apf-topnews\",\"name\":\"AP Top News\",\"canonicalName\":\"ap-top-news\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"apf-usnews\",\"name\":\"U.S. News\",\"canonicalName\":\"us-news\",\"isPr\":false},{\"id\":\"apf-religion\",\"name\":\"Religion\",\"canonicalName\":\"religion\",\"isPr\":false}],\"textColor\":null,\"layoutType\":null,\"customLayoutType\":null,\"endDateTime\":null,\"teamLimit\":25,\"medalCounts\":null,\"medalsUpdated\":null,\"notificationUrl\":null,\"notificationText\":null,\"notificationTitle\":null,\"notificationType\":null,\"notificationUpdated\":null},{\"id\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:7fc6453da08039ece43c6403b2633016\",\"shortId\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:7fc6453da08039ece43c6403b2633016\",\"allowAd\":true,\"borderColor\":null,\"brackets\":null,\"bracketsSettings\":null,\"cardTitle\":null,\"cardHeadline\":null,\"cardType\":\"Wire Story\",\"collectionTagObjs\":null,\"contents\":[{\"id\":\"urn:publicid:ap.org:7fc6453da08039ece43c6403b2633016\",\"shortId\":\"7fc6453da08039ece43c6403b2633016\",\"bylines\":\"By LINDSAY WHITEHURST and RUSS BYNUM\",\"canonicalUrl\":\"ahmaud-arbery-georgia-race-and-ethnicity-shootings-brunswick\",\"contentType\":\"text\",\"disableConnatix\":false,\"downloadSettings\":{},\"embedCaption\":null,\"embedHeight\":null,\"embedHTML\":null,\"embedLinkURL\":null,\"firstWords\":\"\\\\u003cp>BRUNSWICK, Ga.

It projects 2.8 million foreign visitors by the end of the year, a sliver of the 13.5 million who visited in 2019.
